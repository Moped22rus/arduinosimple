The basic structure of the Arduino program consists of at least two mandatory parts: the setup functions() and loop().

Before the setup function() there is a declaration of variables, connection of libraries. Setup function() starts once after each power-up or reset of the Arduino board.

The loop() function in an infinite loop sequentially executes the commands that are described in its body.
